          <li>As so-called “digital natives”, where do you see literacy (of language, image, culture, tech, etc.) valued and/or devalued on the Web or amongst users of the Web? Are there notable advantages or disadvantages of any perceived shifts in recent years?</li>

          <li>Are there any technological or societal speculations mentioned in this conversation that have come to be realized in the 11 years since these statements were made? Any that you see as irrelevant?</li>
